User Authentication: Users can log in with their credentials.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Secure Password Storage: Passwords are hashed using werkzeug.security.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.

Flask: Web framework for building the API.

Flask-SQLAlchemy: ORM for database management.

SQLite: Lightweight database for storing user data.

Ngrok: For exposing the local server to the internet (used in Google Colab).
